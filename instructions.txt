To start the app:

1. Once you have the file cloned from github, open up the terminal and type "npm i" to install all dependencies.
2. Then create a file (outside the views folder) called .env
3. In this .env file type PORT = 3001 on line 1.
4. Then copy this onto line 2:
    DATABASE_URL = postgres://tvleuawxdhxqtv:c6edec315ab32bbb293adc63dbafddcda19e39387427fe0aaffc1ff1e143d082@ec2-54-90-13-87.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/de6c54d8klo9ch
    
    Then save.
2. Afterwards in the terminal, type "npm run dev".
3. Go to localhost:3001 and the app should be loaded and working.
