To start the app:

1. Once you have the file cloned from github, open up the terminal and type "npm i" to install all dependencies.
2. Afterwards in the terminal, type "node app.js" or "nodemon app.js". 
    (Node would work better due to the server restarting when users are created / edited / deleted with nodemon.)
3. Go to localhost:3000 and the app should be loaded and working.
